## Major features

geiger is a (growing) collection of methods developed over the years by many researchers.
Here is a a non-comprehensive list of methods:

* Fit continuous models of evolution (BM, OU, EB, Pagel models, etc.)
* Fit discrete models of evolution (Mk and variants)
* [Identify shifts in the rate of continuous trait evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01401.x/abstract)
* [Fit continuous trait models to unresolved data using ABC](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01474.x/abstract)
* [Use fossil information to improve macroevolutionary inference](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01723.x/abstract)
* [Identify shifts in the rate of diversification](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0811087106}
* [Posterior predictive model assessment](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/3/293)
* [Time-scaling large phylogenies with 'congruification'](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12051/full)
